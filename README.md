 Re-creating the legendary rain falling symbols from the matrix movie, using OOP design patterns while manipulating the HTML canvas.
 The functionality relies on 3 classes (MatrixEffect, MatrixAnimation, MatrixSymbol), where each one handles individual task,
 as for the symbols im using Korean, Japanese and Greek alphabet characters and the numbers of 1 and 0.
